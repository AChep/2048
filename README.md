2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game designed by Italian web developer Gabriele Cirulli.
The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048;
however, one can continue to play the game after reaching the goal, creating tiles with larger numbers.
